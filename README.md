# UnitConverter
Project for [100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 19 challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19).

The Hacking with Swift web site, run by Paul Hudson (@twostraws), has a course titled "100 Days of SwiftUI". This course has several milestones
called "Challenge Days", where the student is encouraged to write a SwiftUI application based on the instruction provided to that point. The
first of these challenges occurs on Day 19. Several possibilities are suggested, one of which is a unit converter. That is the direction I chose.

Notably, this app makes use of the Measure generic struct and its associated conversion methods provided in the Swift Foundation framework.
